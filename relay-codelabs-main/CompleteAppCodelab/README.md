# Reflect: A Daily Habit Tracker

This directory contains source code for *Reflect*, an example Android
application written using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
and [Relay](https://relay.material.io/).

Reflect allows users to create personalized data trackers, enter daily values,
and track them over time. This project is part of a codelab that focuses on
crafting the user interface components using Relay, specifically:

1. Importing components from Figma as UI packages
2. Adding interaction and behavior
3. Integrating application themes
4. Mapping UI packages to custom components
