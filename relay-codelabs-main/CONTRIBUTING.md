# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Relay codelabs. At this time,
we are not accepting external contributions to this project. The codelabs are

up to date with Relay itself.

identify problems and improve Relay for everyone.

When submitting bugs, please include as much information as you can, including
steps to reproduce the issue, relevant screenshots or error logs, and details
about the Figma file and Android Studio project in use.
